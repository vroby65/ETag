# ETag

Description

The etag script is a command-line tool written in Python that allows you to retrieve the ETag (Entity Tag) value from a web server's response. The ETag is a mechanism used for web caching and can be useful for tracking changes to a resource on the server.

By providing the URL of the web server as a command-line argument, the script sends a GET request to the specified URL and captures the ETag value from the response headers. If the request is successful (status code 200) and an ETag is present, the script displays the ETag value on the screen. If the ETag is not found in the server's response, it indicates this information. In case the request fails, an appropriate error message is shown.

The etag script is a handy utility for developers and system administrators who need to analyze or monitor web resources and their caching behavior. It can be easily integrated into existing scripts or used standalone to quickly fetch and inspect ETag values from web servers.

Please note that Python and the requests library need to be installed for the script to run successfully. You can install the requests library using the command pip install requests.
